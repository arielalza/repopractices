###Personal note reminder: The double "##" means that part works

#Firts steps on python =)

##print( 7%(5//2) )
##print( (3**2)//2 )
 

#Part 1: Core python, basic concepts, strings & variables, functions & modules
#regular expressions, control structures, and more.

#Choice $1.000.000 or 0.01 doubled every day for 30 days.
#Task: Write a program to calculate the result amount from the doubling penny.
##print(0.01*(2**30))
#Thats result in 10737418.24 (first attemp and correct)

#For some text we need use the backslash \. For example to use single quote
#in texts. 
#This doesn't works. The output results in syntax error because we don't use \
#print('Hi I'm Ariel')
#This print works, the output is 'Hi I'm Ariel'
##print('Hi I\'m Ariel')

#We can use the \ for other things (like in bash) for new tabs = \t 
#for new lines =  \n 
#and other uses.And we can use triple quote that automatically add new
#lines for strings example:
##print("""there are 
#multiple
#lines""")
